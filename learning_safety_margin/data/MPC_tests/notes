# Target(time)

at beginning of traj horizon is far-> computes large delta_position with nn-zero velocities 
at end of traj, target is very close -> delta_position very small with zero velocities, robot unable to execute (due to) friction??



# target(state)
might be similar problem, other issue is :
end of traj, small delta_pos with small velocities, robot is stuck with same target idx that is too close 

with low velicty weights in planner (1) and high mcd pos filtering (.9) in control ->relatively smooth traj
n_steps > 5 otherwise robot doesn't move
acc limit was at .5


if accel limit too low, shoudl look further in future 




both give very jittery trajectories, target(state) is worse
